### ✨ **Abstract:**

This project provides a **deep dive** into the process of creating a **2D indie game** using the **Unity Game Engine**. From the meticulous creation of **pixel art assets** to crafting **normal assets** using tools like *Adobe Photoshop*, *Adobe Illustrator*, and *Blender*, every detail is covered. The pipeline involves creating **sprite sheets** for animating characters and objects. 

We’ll also implement an **astute AI system** using the **A\*** algorithm for **real-time enemy movement**, where the enemy hunts the player using the shortest path possible. Along with AI, the game incorporates **Unity’s physics components** such as **colliders** and **raycasting** for realistic interactions.

Once the game is complete, we’ll gather **feedback** through a **post-use questionnaire** designed for all age groups. This will allow for **statistical analysis** of the game’s **feel, theme, and environment**, and identify areas for **improvement**. Finally, **quality evaluation** will be carried out to ensure **smooth gameplay** and **high visual appeal**.
